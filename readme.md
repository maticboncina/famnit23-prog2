# UP FAMNIT - Programming 2 (Functional Programming) - 2023/2024

Professor: dr. Iztok Savnik

Practice assistant: dr. Peter Mur≈°iƒç

## Intro 

The repository serves as a personal archive of all code written during the course of Programming 2 at UP FAMNIT. The code is written in OCAML using this [online compiler](https://ocaml.famn.it).

**!!! Code in this repository is a wild mix of genius and "oopsie doopsies" - it‚Äôs shared !!! after !!! submitting my assignments, so expect adventures (and bugs). Use or copy at your risk !!!**

**FOR "I AM THE SMARTEST IDIOT" CLASSMATE(S): this IS NOT a free ride for your homework. When you get caught using my gigabrain, I'll proudly wave this repository, timestamps, hidden indicators, as proof of my originality while you get a front-row seat to your ethics hearing. Consider yourself warned üíÖ**

## Folder structure

1. Classification based on class type:
    - `homework` - Contains code from homeworks.
    - `practice`
      - `lab` - Contains code we wrote during the lab practice.
      
2. Organised code by dates (yyyy-mm-dd).

3. Optionally organised further to maintain a clean structure.
